# `CodeLib.RustStd.Array` — the `&[T]` slice trunk

A Rust slice `&[T]` is compiled to a **fat pointer**: a data pointer and an
element count, both carried as `i32` (a `usize` on `wasm32`). Every reasoning
fact about a slice operation is a fact about these two `i32` components — the
element type `T` never appears, which is exactly why one proof serves `&[u8]`,
`&[u64]`, `&[Foo]`, … alike.

The operations in this corpus (`len`, `is_empty`) inspect only the **length**
component, so on the value stack each is a **unary transform of one `i32`** — the
exact shape the integer trunk `CodeLib/RustStd/UInt.lean` already abstracts as
`UnChunk` (over any `UIntWasm` type; here `UInt32`, whose `toV` is `.i32`).
So a length-only op needs *no new chunk shape*: its chunk is a `UnChunk` instance
(`Len.len_chunk`, `IsEmpty.isEmpty_chunk`) and its called monomorphized body is
discharged by the trunk's `unBodyReturnsWp` (`Len.lenBodyWp`,
`IsEmpty.isEmptyBodyWp`) — the same `unBodyReturnsWp` reads the length from an
**arbitrary** local `i` (slices carry the length in the second fat-pointer field,
e.g. param local `1`), so nothing slice-specific is needed there.

The one genuinely new unit here is `fatPtrLoadWp`: unlike a scalar, a slice
crosses the C ABI **spilled to linear memory**, so the export wrapper must read
the `(dataPtr, len)` fields back before it can feed a `UnChunk`/called body. That
memory marshalling has no integer-trunk analogue, so it lives here.

Scope: a length-only op's length reaches the stack either from a **local** (the
inlined read and the called monomorphized body, via the trunk's
`wp_localGet_cons`/`unBodyReturnsWp`) or from **linear memory** (`fatPtrLoadWp`
below, used by the export wrappers in `RustArray/Spec.lean`). Because `UnChunk`
is stated in stack form, both sources feed the *same* `isEmpty_chunk`/`len_chunk`
— a new length source only needs its own loader, never a reformulation. Still
genuinely out of scope (a different chunk shape, not a `UnChunk` instance): a
*binary* slice fact such as an `idx < len` bounds check for `get`/indexing,
which relates two `i32`s rather than transforming one (that is the trunk's
`BinChunk`).

/-! ## Memory-resident slices

A slice handed across the C ABI is spilled to linear memory: the caller passes a
single `i32` pointer `p` to a `(dataPtr, len)` fat pointer laid out as two
adjacent `i32`s (`dataPtr` at `p+0`, `len` at `p+4`). An export wrapper reads the
fat pointer back with `localGet p; load32 0; localGet p; load32 4` before calling
the monomorphized body. `fatPtrLoadWp` is that read as a reusable chunk: it puts
`len` (and the data pointer below it) on the stack, which a `UnChunk`/called
body then consumes. It needs the fat pointer to be in bounds and the two memory
words to hold the fat-pointer fields — both facts the caller supplies, bundled as
`FatPtrAt`. -/

/-- The fat-pointer ABI contract at memory address `p`: the caller has spilled a
`(dataPtr, len)` fat pointer to linear memory (`dataPtr` at `p+0`, `len` at
`p+4`), with the whole 8-byte pointer in bounds. This is the single shared
precondition every memory-resident slice export carries; `fatPtrLoadWp` consumes
exactly these three facts. Factoring it here keeps the export specs from
restating the layout, and means a future layout change (offsets, alignment, a
third field) is edited in one place. -/
structure FatPtrAt {α : Type} (st : Store α) (p dataPtr len : UInt32) : Prop where
  /-- The data pointer lives in the first word, at `p+0`. -/
  data : st.mem.read32 (p + 0) = dataPtr
  /-- The element count lives in the second word, at `p+4`. -/
  count : st.mem.read32 (p + 4) = len
  /-- The whole 8-byte fat pointer is in bounds. -/
  bound : p.toNat + 8 ≤ st.mem.pages * 65536

/-- Reusable fat-pointer-from-memory reader: given local `i` holds the fat-pointer
address `p` and the `FatPtrAt` ABI contract holds, the loader fragment pushes
`len` on top of `dataPtr` (the call-argument order the monomorphized
`len`/`is_empty` body expects). The trailing `rest` and the existing stack `vs`
stay free, so this composes wherever a memory-resident slice's length is needed. -/

called body with `len` on top of `dataPtr`. Every export wrapper in the slice
corpora opens the same way; this is that opener as one tactic so the peel set and
