# NEAR host state (`α := NearState`)

The interpreter threads an opaque `host : α` slot through `Store α`; host
imports are the only code that inspects it. This module instantiates that
slot for the **NEAR Protocol** smart-contract host environment.

`NearState` is the part of the NEAR runtime a single contract call can
observe and mutate:

* `storage`   — the contract's storage trie, modelled as a *pure function*
  `key → Option value` (mirroring `Mem.bytes : Nat → UInt8`). This is the
  "projection of NEAR state" specs reason about before/after a call; the
  function model supports `∀ key` (frame) reasoning directly, and NEAR's
  storage-iterator host functions are deprecated so contracts can't
  enumerate keys anyway — only ghost specs do, via quantifiers.
* `registers` — the NEAR register ABI scratch buffers (`id → bytes`). Host
  functions that "return" variable-length data write it to a register; the
  contract then copies it into linear memory via `read_register`.
* `context`   — immutable call context (account ids, input bytes, deposit).
* `returnData` / `logs` — outputs produced via `value_return` / logging.

Promises / cross-contract calls are deliberately out of scope for now.

The host-function semantics live in `CodeLib/Near/Env.lean`; this file is
just the state shape plus the pure helpers those functions are built from.

namespace Wasm

/-- `2^64 - 1`, the NEAR register/length sentinel. Used by host functions
that read an argument through `getMemOrReg`: a length field equal to this
value means "the pointer is a register id, take the bytes already in that
register" rather than "read this many bytes of linear memory". -/
def u64Max : UInt64 := 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

/-- Read `len` consecutive bytes of linear memory starting at byte offset
`off`. Total (out-of-range addresses read whatever `bytes` returns there);
callers bounds-check first. The `List.range`-map shape is the canonical
"easy to `simp`/compute through" form, matching `Mem.fill`/`Mem.copy`. -/
def Mem.readBytes (m : Mem) (off len : Nat) : List UInt8 :=
  (List.range len).map (fun i => m.bytes (off + i))

/-- Immutable per-call NEAR context. Account ids and `input` are raw byte
strings (NEAR account ids are UTF-8; contract input is opaque bytes,
conventionally JSON or Borsh). `attachedDeposit` is a yoctoNEAR `u128`,
written to memory as 16 little-endian bytes by `attached_deposit`. -/

/-- The NEAR `get_memory_or_register` input convention. For an input
`(ptr, len)` pair: when `len = u64Max`, `ptr` is a *register id* and the
bytes are taken from that register (`none` if the register is unset, which
the caller turns into a trap); otherwise it reads `len` bytes of linear
memory starting at `ptr`. Used uniformly by `storage_*` (keys/values) and
`value_return`. The output `register_id` of a host function is **never**
sentinel-encoded — only these input pairs are. -/
